# Movie App

Film, a movie app built with **React** + **Vite**, state managed using **Redux** and axios for fetching data from TMDB API endpoints.

## Motive

A challenge inspired by Adrian of JSM (such a great tutor) from the first render to an absolute app ready fro production. Though not a big fan of movies but this now can serve as a pseudo movie playlist.
